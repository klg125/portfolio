### Opioid-Related Emergency Department Admissions Prediction through Internet Search Keywords
[Report](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/Opioid_STEMFellowship.pdf)
Employed a polynomial regression model to examine whether keywords from Google Trends can predict opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits; accounted for 99% of variance in ED visits through best-fitting model.

### Constructing a Portfolio from Sentiments of Stock Ticker Symbols and Live News
[Report](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/StockReturns.pdf)

Built sentiment-based portfolio by normalizing likability of ticker symbol and by regressing this portfolio on the Fama-French three-factor model; achieved 0.027% monthly outperformance compared to benchmark portfolio.

### TelePrime Customer Churn Prediction 
[View Notebook](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/TelePrime%20Churn.pdf)
Standardized 12 continuous features on credit score and customer demographics, creating 5 derived features on tenure length. Leveraged stepAIC to remove 6 features; applied logistic regression on finalized dataset; visualized accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of model to locate 36.7% as the optimal probability cutoff to increase true positive rate.

### Biomedical Genome Regression 
[View Notebook](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/Regression%20in%20Biomedical%20Research_Github.pdf)
Fitted regression tree to Trp63 genome dataset (3K rows and 230 features) to discover important transcription gene predictors. I applied pruning and bagging with best parameter from CV; found 3 influential genes through random forest and lasso regression.
