### Opioid-Related Emergency Department Admissions Prediction through Internet Search Keywords
[Report](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/Opioid_STEMFellowship.pdf)
Employed a polynomial regression model to examine whether keywords from Google Trends can predict opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits; accounted for 99% of variance in ED visits through best-fitting model.

### Constructing a Portfolio from Sentiments of Stock Ticker Symbols and Live News
[Report](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/StockReturns.pdf)

Built sentiment-based portfolio by normalizing likability of ticker symbol and by regressing this portfolio on the Fama-French three-factor model; achieved 0.027% monthly outperformance compared to benchmark portfolio.

### TelePrime Customer Churn Prediction 
[View Notebook](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/TelePrime%20Churn.pdf)
Standardized 12 continuous features on credit score and customer demographics, creating 5 derived features on tenure length. Leveraged stepAIC to remove 6 features; applied logistic regression on finalized dataset; visualized accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of model to locate 36.7% as the optimal probability cutoff to increase true positive rate.

### Biomedical Genome Regression 
[View Notebook](https://github.com/klg125/portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/Regression%20in%20Biomedical%20Research_Github.pdf)
Fitted regression tree to Trp63 genome dataset (3K rows and 230 features) to discover important transcription gene predictors. I applied pruning and bagging with best parameter from CV; found 3 influential genes through random forest and lasso regression. 

### Dillard Inventory Management 
This project aimed to enhance inventory management at Dillardâ€™s by predicting quarterly selling prices and reducing inventory-related costs using a comprehensive predictive model. Utilizing extensive transaction data, the model integrated features such as purchase frequency, customer demographics, and SKU characteristics, achieving a significant model uplift with a 21.6% reduction in inventory costs over three quarters in 2005. The predictive model, notably refined using XGBoost which yielded the best performance with an MSE of 0.267

### Spaceship Titanic 
The project's objective was to predict passengers likely to be transported to another dimension aboard the Spaceship Titanic for enhanced rescue operations. Leveraging a dataset of 8693 rows and 14 columns, extensive feature engineering was conducted, including the creation of new features like 'Total Expenditure' and 'No Spending Indicator' to capture spending behavior and social dynamics. Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LGBMclassifier were tested, with the latter achieving the highest validation accuracy of 80.73% and an AUC of 0.91.
